Overview

Climate change and environmental degradation are becoming an existential threat to Europe and the world, though inevitably, transitioning to a sustainable future with inclusive, green economies and resilient ecosystems is associated with many challenges. Within DIGITAL, we will make financial strategies for sustainable investing more objective, optimised, integrated, and operational, measure the social and environmental effects of sustainable finance, define the primary characteristics of sustainable financial assets and instruments and overcome the most significant obstacles to implementing sustainable finance strategies.

Within this research topic, a novel study will be conducted to simulate and evaluate markets in order to replicate the relationship between banks, financial institutions, and their retail and business clients in a sustainable environment that takes into account various factors (e.g., Green AI and green credit score). To evaluate markets, numerous indicators and metrics, including loan interest rate, customer attrition, CO2 emissions, customers' access to credit, and firms' profits, will be compared. We will use agent-based modelling for the first time to simulate different market scenarios in which agents involved in the industry take sustainable actions. Long-term financial growth will be analysed, and the findings will inform the development and modification of industry policies and strategies. This will ensure that sustainability considerations are integral to the Digital Finance industry, contributing to the European Green Deal in the process.

Research topics

Under this research stream, FOUR doctoral candidates will tackle the following research projects:

IRP 2: Modelling green credit scores for a network of retail and business clients

Modelling green credit scores for a network of retail and business clients

Description:

Some markets use green credit scores to assess SME credit risk in sustainable and circular economies. Simultaneously, network customers' default likelihood has been studied. This study develops and deploys green credit score models that account for customers' networks. We show the impact and give financial institutions methods to improve credit risk assessment and access.

Host:

University of Twente

Planned Secondments:

Swedbank (SWE).

Prof. Dr. Tadas Gudaitis, M21, 6 months, ESG and credit score modelling

Bank for International Settlement (BIS).

Rafael Schmidt, M27, 18 months, contribute macro-economic datasets, ongoing projects as well as overall expertise in banking supervision

IRP 4: A recommender system to re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and businesses

A recommender system to re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and businesses

Description:

Recommender systems are well-known information filtering systems that suggest items most relevant to a user. To our knowledge, there are none that suggest investments in sustainable technologies and businesses. This project will develop and deploy a recommender system to help financial institutions and their clients invest in sustainable technologies.

IRP 10: Experimenting with Green AI to reduce processing time and contributes to creating a low-carbon economy

Experimenting with Green AI to reduce processing time and contributes to creating a low-carbon economy

Description:

Green AI supports the use of resources more efficiently and conserves them for future generations. Multiple applications have been presented in different areas, however, there are no studies exploring the impact that the use of green AI concepts can have in the Financial industry. This research objective focuses on experimenting with green AI concepts in multiple applications in finance, analysing economical and practical impact of its deployment in industry. It facilitates the exchange of innovative ideas and cooperation opportunities in the field of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), Sustainable Finance, and ESG Technology.

Host:

University of Naples Federico II

Planned Secondments:

IRP 11: Applications of Agent-based Models (ABM) to analyse finance growth in a sustainable manner over a long-term period

Applications of Agent-based Models (ABM) to analyse finance growth in a sustainable manner over a long-term period

Description:

Agent-based systems are computer models that simulate the behaviours and interactions of autonomous agents, either as individuals or in groups, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how a system behaves and what factors influence its outcomes. In agent-based modelling, a system is represented as a collection of autonomous decision-making units, or agents (ABM). Each agent evaluates its own situation and makes decisions according to a set of rules. Agents are capable of a variety of appropriate behaviours for the system they represent. ABM has been utilised in numerous financial investigations. The literature contains few ABM studies that model economies and markets while assuming the industry's adoption of sustainable finance
