## Overview

AI-driven innovation can bring enormous benefits but such complex solutions are often referred to as “black boxes” because typically it is difficult to trace the steps the algorithms took to arrive at its conclusions. DIGITAL will describe how well XAI tools meet the explainability requirements of various financial value chain stakeholders, develop non-perturbation-based XAI methods that preserve the natural time ordering and dependence structures of the data and create methodologies to ensure that algorithmic systems do not produce socially biassed outcomes that exacerbate inequalities.

This research topic will address the crucial question of how to build trust in human-centric AI models as opposed to the currently widespread AI black boxes, which do not meet the modern European requirements of explainability, trust and unbiasedness. We will validate the applicability of state-of-the-art XAI algorithms to financial applications and extend XAI frameworks, ensuring that complex models applied to financial use cases satisfy the explainability requirements of different stakeholders within the finance value chain and do not reinforce social biases. A qualitative evaluation of the comprehensive frameworks' insights into explainability will be made in comparison to the baseline models. Through industry-ready use cases, we will demonstrate for the first time ever the viability of the proposed framework for audience-dependent explanations, the novel time-series XAI methods, and the fair algorithmic designs.

## Research topics

Under this research stream, FOUR doctoral candidates will tackle the following research projects:

### Audience-dependent explanations

[Audience-dependent explanations](/audience-dependent-explanations/)

Description:  To address the issue of explainability in complex models, the literature has proposed an ever-expanding list of post-hoc explainability methods that can be used to gain some understanding of the inner workings of complex models. However, explaining the inner workings of algorithms and their interpretation is entirely dependent on the target audience. The existing literature fails to match the growing number of explainable AI (XAI) methods with the varying explainability requirements of stakeholders. To promote the widespread adoption of AI-based systems in finance, additional research is required to map the requirements of explainable systems across the various stakeholders in the finance industry.

  

Host: [University of Naples Federico II](/partners/university-of-naples-federico-ii/)

  

Planned Secondments:

Swedbank AB (SWE), Prof. Dr. Tadas Gudaitis, M21, 18 months, policies for asset, sustainable fund management

Fraunhofer Institute (FRA), Prof. Dr. Ralf Korn, M39, 6 months, improve know-how transfer by using and implementing advanced financial models

  

  

### Investigating the utility of classical XAI methods in financial time series

[Investigating the utility of classical XAI methods in financial time series ](/investigating-the-utility/)

  

Description:  The introduction of complex ML and DL methods for financial time series forecasts potentially enables higher predictive accuracy but this comes at the cost of higher complexity and thus lower interpretability. For cross sectional data classical XAI approaches can lead to valuable insights about the models’ inner workings, but these techniques generally cannot cope well with longitudinal data (time series) in the presence of dependence structure and non-stationarity. The literature currently does not offer any XAI approach that is specifically developed for financial time series. Further research is needed on developing explainability methods that can be applied to complex models like deep learning methods (DL) which preserve and exploit the natural time ordering of the data.

  

Host: [Bern Business School](/bern-university-of-applied-sciences-bfh/)

Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Rafael Schmidt, M39, 6 months, contribute macro-economic datasets, ongoing projects as well as overall expertise in banking supervision

### Fair Algorithmic Design and Portfolio Optimization under Sustainability Concerns

[Fair Algorithmic Design and Portfolio Optimization under Sustainability Concerns](/fair-algorithmic-design/)

  

Description: The surge in interest in algorithmic fairness and sustainability is present in numerous fields of study, including finance and portfolio management in particular. This project's objective is to create new portfolio optimization models that address some of the difficulties associated with incorporating fairness and sustainability into investment management. The objective of the project is to increase understanding of the source and methods for eliminating algorithmic bias in finance in order to generate sustainable outcomes. The project will equip financial institutions with new sustainable and equitable algorithmic solutions to increase customer trust.

### Strengthening European financial service providers through applicable reinforcement learning

[Strengthening European financial service providers through applicable reinforcement learning](/strengthening-european-financial/)

  

Description: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become popular for automating uncertain decision-making in complex environments. Deep reinforcement learning can make impressive algorithmic decisions in closed environments, but real-world applications in open environments are harder. This project examines how RL can advance digital finance.
