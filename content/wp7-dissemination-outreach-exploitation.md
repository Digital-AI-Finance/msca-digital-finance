## Overview

WP 7 is led by BFH and supported by all partners. The work is divided into the following tasks:

  * Establish the dissemination team (one representative per partner).

  * Establish an online communication infrastructure within DIGITAL for the main network communication.

  * Define a dissemination and exploitation strategy, which will detail the communication protocols, intervals and channels.

  * Launch of the external communication channels of DIGITAL (e.g. website, social media channels and GitHub repository).

  * Maintain a database that records the progress and impact of the network in all its aspects

  * Ensure exploitation to a large number of industry partners, including banks, Fintechs, technology and software providers, consulting companies, companies from other industries

  * Support the research WPs to deploy use cases and prototypes and enhance exploitation and 2 spin-offs

## Purpose

### Objectives

The WP will focus on dissemination, outreach and exploitation of results.

  * O 7.1. To promote and raise awareness on the network's training and research program and its potential impact through digital channels

  * O 7.2. To provide information and access to the network, its research, policy and industry-specific results, conferences, and activities.

  * O 7.3 To create impact in the research, industry and regulatory community by validating the results of the IRPs through: (i) publications

in high quality scientific journals; (ii) industry use cases, and (iii) policy papers discussed with international regulatory bodies.

### Deliverables

  * D.7.1 Dissemination and Exploitation Plan M13: Plan for the dissemination and exploitation of results, including communication activities, submitted at mid-term (M13) and an update towards the end of the project (M48). This plan should be periodically updated, and an updated version is required by M48.

This plan for the exploitation should address both internal impacts (such as internal research, collaborative research using the network, product development with the industrial partners) on the network as well as external impacts (such as impact on industry and academia outside the consortium, policy makers and regulators and civil society.) The dissemination part should clearly specify and detail specific criteria and the structure for impact monitoring.

  * D.7.2 Website: Project website (Due in M2)

  * D.7.3 Dissemination and exploitation repository (including research training): Repository for all dissemination materials periodically updated (Due in M3)

  * D.7.4 Dissemination and Exploitation Plan M48: Plan for the dissemination and exploitation of results, including communication activities, submitted at mid-term (M13) and an update towards the end of the project (M48). This plan should be periodically updated, and an updated version is required by M48. This plan for the exploitation should address both internal impacts (such as internal research, collaborative research using the network, product development with the industrial partners) on the network as well as external impacts (such as impact on industry and academia outside the consortium, policy makers and regulators and civil society.) The dissemination part should clearly specify and detail specific criteria and the structure for impact monitoring.
