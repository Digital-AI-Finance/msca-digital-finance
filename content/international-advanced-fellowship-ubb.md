# Description of the Research Project

# Background: The ongoing programme for strengthening and supporting research excellence at the Babeș-Bolyai University (UBB) is further developed through the “STAR-UBB Academic Research Network of Excellence (STAR-UBB-N)” project [https://cercetare.ubbcluj.ro/ro/proiect-pfe-550-ubb-%cb%9dreteaua-academica-de-cercetare-de-excelenta-star-ubb-star-ubb-n%cb%9d/](https://cercetare.ubbcluj.ro/ro/proiect-pfe-550-ubb-%CB%9Dreteaua-academica-de-cercetare-de-excelenta-star-ubb-star-ubb-n%CB%9D/), based on the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM+) model implemented at an institutional level and coordinated by the Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology – STAR-UBB – (STAR – Scientific and Technological Advanced Research). STAR-UBB-N comprises six academic science centres (centres coordinating and connecting the RDI activities in faculty RDI laboratories/units, anchored in the UBB strategic infrastructure), under the coordination of the STAR-UBB Institute. The academic science centres established according to the project are: 1. Virtual Labs Centre, affiliated to the Academic School of Natural and Life Sciences; 2. Virtual & Practical Engineering Centre, affiliated to the Academic School of Engineering and Technology; 3. eHealth/tHealth Centre, affiliated to the Academic School of Health; 4. Big Data & Machine Learning Centre, affiliated to the Academic School of Social Sciences; 5. Digital Arts & Humanities Centre, affiliated to the Academic School of Humanities and Arts; 6. Ethics & Sacred Music Centre, affiliated to the Academic School of Theology. The themes of the centres were specifically selected to reflect: (1) European priorities; (2) multi-/inter-/trans-disciplinary approaches; (3) 21st century professional and scientific human resource development requirements; (4) strategic competitive strengths/advantages of UBB. The project thus aims to reinforce and coordinate the UBB multi-level and interlinked strategic academic/scientific infrastructure, the UBB Academic Schools and the STAR-UBB Institute. The scope of the project, in line with the inter-, multi- and trans-disciplinary UBB profile, covers new and emerging technologies, while the specific technologies advanced by the present project fall under the umbrella defined by UBB through its InfoBioNano4Health smart specialisation project. By establishing the STAR-UBB-N network, the multi-/inter-/trans-disciplinary development in the academic culture of UBB is thereby fostered, with a positive impact on the RDI activities and the academic competitiveness of UBB.  
​  
Requirements:  
The implementation of the project within the International Advanced Fellowship Programme at UBB requires each recipient to:  

  * # organise under the aegis of the STAR-UBB-N network at least one (online/on-site) conference/ scientific dissemination/ scientific seminar/ workshop/ lecture on topics relevant to new and emerging technologies in the InfoBioNano4Health paradigm, in order to contribute to the development directions of the six academic science centres within STAR-UBB-N;

  * # write and submit for publication at least one scientific paper in collaboration with an academic/researcher from STAR-UBB-N, on multi- and trans-disciplinary scientific research topics of relevance to the network/ UBB Academic Science Schools/ STAR-UBB Institute, in WoS/Scopus/ERIH+ indexed journals/proceedings.

  * # ensure that any publication/output produced (including conferences/scientific disseminations/scientific seminars/workshops/lectures) and reported as a result of the activities funded by the International Advanced Fellowship-UBB programme will mention the name of the funder (Babeș-Bolyai University) and the funding contract details (nr.21PFE/ 30.12.2021, ID: PFE-550-UBB)

  * # submit at the end of the month covered by the fellowship grant an activity report indicating the status of the project output/implementation, endorsed by the UBB scientific coordinator;

###### Enhancing security in blockchain networks: Anomalies, frauds, and advanced detection techniques  
Osterrieder, J., Chan, S., Chu, J., Zhang, Y., Hadji Misheva, B., & Mare, C. (2024). Enhancing security in blockchain networks: Anomalies, frauds, and advanced detection techniques. Financial Innovation. Manuscript under review.

Blockchain technology, a foundational distributed ledger system, enables secure and transparent multi-party transactions. Despite its advantages, blockchain networks are susceptible to anomalies and frauds, posing significant risks to their integrity and security. This paper offers a detailed examination of blockchain's key definitions and properties, alongside a thorough analysis of the various anomalies and frauds that undermine these networks. It describes an array of detection and prevention strategies, encompassing statistical and machine learning methods, game-theoretic solutions, digital forensics, reputation-based systems, and comprehensive risk assessment techniques. Through case studies, we explore practical applications of anomaly and fraud detection in blockchain networks, extracting valuable insights and implications for both current practice and future research. Moreover, we spotlight emerging trends and challenges within the field, proposing directions for future investigation and technological development. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, this paper seeks to provide a technical, in-depth overview of anomaly and fraud detection within blockchain networks, marking a significant step forward in the search for enhanced network security and reliability.

# Academic Events

The team has received invitations to numerous international conferences, serving roles as keynote speakers, session chairs, or even organizing the events themselves.
