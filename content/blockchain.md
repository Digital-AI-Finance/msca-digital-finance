# Description of the Research Project

# Background: Blockchain networks are increasingly being implemented into healthcare, supply chain, and retail systems, through smart contracts, smart devices, smart identity management. Although the use of this technology brings with it benefits, it can also still cause problems. A particular problem is derived from the immutability property, which means that fraudulent transactions or transfers of information cannot be reversed.  
​  
Rationale: Blockchains can be attacked via a deluge of requests or transactions within a short time span, resulting in the loss of connectivity to the blockchain for users and businesses, or even financial institutions. Therefore, the rapid detection of anomalies from such activities is critical in order to prevent damage from occurring, or correct any damage as soon as possible to reduce the severity of its impact.  
  
Overall objectives: This project will study the problem of anomaly and fraud detection from the perspective of blockchain-based networks. Anomaly and fraud detection in blockchain-based networks is more complex due to their unique properties such as decentralisation, global reach, anonymity, etc., which make them different from traditional networks.  
  
Specific aims: To further the understanding of the sources and behaviours of anomalies and fraud in blockchain-based networks, and develop new improved methods for both static and dynamic anomaly detection that can be used alongside blockchain-based systems for real-time fraud detection.  
  
Methods: Developing and implementing static anomaly detection methods via a hybrid approach and developing dynamic anomaly detection methods using extreme value theory.   
  
Expected results: This research work will be able to contribute to improving the security relating to blockchain-based networks by providing more accurate and efficient methods for detecting anomalies and fraud and reducing the impact of losses resulting from these anomalies.  
  
Impact for the field: The project will be particularly beneficial alongside real world blockchain-based networks to allow for the fast detection of anomalous or fraudulent data, preventing damage or allowing for damage to be corrected as soon as possible. For cryptocurrency networks, this will reduce the impact of market manipulation, fraud, and more widely on global financial markets, currencies, and trade. In addition, the project will be of interest to a broad range of cryptocurrency and blockchain stakeholders including (but not limited to) academics, financial institutions,policymakers, regulators, and cybercrime agencies.

Blockchain technology, a foundational distributed ledger system, enables secure and transparent multi-party transactions. Despite its advantages, blockchain networks are susceptible to anomalies and frauds, posing significant risks to their integrity and security. This paper offers a detailed examination of blockchain's key definitions and properties, alongside a thorough analysis of the various anomalies and frauds that undermine these networks. It describes an array of detection and prevention strategies, encompassing statistical and machine learning methods, game-theoretic solutions, digital forensics, reputation-based systems, and comprehensive risk assessment techniques. Through case studies, we explore practical applications of anomaly and fraud detection in blockchain networks, extracting valuable insights and implications for both current practice and future research. Moreover, we spotlight emerging trends and challenges within the field, proposing directions for future investigation and technological development. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, this paper seeks to provide a technical, in-depth overview of anomaly and fraud detection within blockchain networks, marking a significant step forward in the search for enhanced network security and reliability.

04 GARCH modelling of cryptocurrencies.

###### Chu, J., Chan, S. and Osterrieder, J., 2017. GARCH modelling of cryptocurrencies. Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 10(4), p.17. [Citations: 340]  

With the exception of Bitcoin, there appears to be little or no literature on GARCH modelling of cryptocurrencies. This paper provides the first GARCH modelling of the seven most popular cryptocurrencies. Twelve GARCH models are fitted to each cryptocurrency, and their fits are assessed in terms of five criteria. Conclusions are drawn on the best fitting models, forecasts and acceptability of value at risk estimates.

05 A statistical analysis of cryptocurrencies

###### Chan, S., Chu, J. and Osterrieder, J., 2017. A statistical analysis of cryptocurrencies. Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 10(2), p.12. [Citations: 213]

We analyze statistical properties of the largest cryptocurrencies (determined by market capitalization), of which Bitcoin is the most prominent example. We characterize their exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar by fitting parametric distributions to them. It is shown that returns are clearly non-normal, however, no single distribution fits well jointly to all the cryptocurrencies analysed. We find that for the most popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, the generalized hyperbolic distribution gives the best fit, while for the smaller cryptocurrencies the normal inverse Gaussian distribution, generalized t distribution, and Laplace distribution give good fits. The results are important for investment and risk management purposes.

06 Lead behaviour in bitcoin markets

###### Y Chen, P Giudici, B Hadji Misheva, S Trimborn. Lead behaviour in bitcoin markets (2020). Risks 8 (1), 4

We aim to understand the dynamics of Bitcoin blockchain trading volumes and, specifically, how different trading groups, in different geographic areas, interact with each other. To achieve this aim, we propose an extended Vector Autoregressive model, aimed at explaining the evolution of trading volumes, both in time and in space. The extension is based on network models, which improve pure autoregressive models, introducing a contemporaneous contagion component that describes contagion effects between trading volumes. Our empirical findings show that transactions activities in bitcoins is dominated by groups of network participants in Europe and in the United States, consistent with the expectation that market interactions primarily take place in developed economies.
