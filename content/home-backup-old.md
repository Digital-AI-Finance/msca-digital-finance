Technology has already changed the way Finance industry works. To deal with the new DIGITAL requirements in both academia and industry and remain at the forefront of financial innovation and research, PhD graduates in Finance will be required to acquire new skills encompassing AI algorithms, data analytics, blockchain infrastructures, and sustainable finance principles.

​

This is DIGITAL FINANCE

[About Us](https://www.digital-finance-msca.com/our-partners)

MSCA Digital Finance

## What is MSCA Digital Finance?

We are an INDUSTRIAL Doctoral Network established within the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions which aims at training highly skilled doctoral candidates in Digital Finance.

What is a MSCA Doctoral Network?

DIGITAL will specifically train young researchers in R&D topics that cover the multiple disciplines required in the rapidly evolving field of Digital Finance substantially going beyond the traditional Finance PhD education in a wide range of inter-sectoral applications: data quality, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), Explainability of AI (XAI), Blockchain applications and sustainable finance; all of which are required for a wide range of industrial (financial products, risk management, customer-centric products, enhanced processes or improved services) and scientific (new AI techniques, new business models, and enhanced modelling) applications, necessitating novel scientific insight, new training courses, and future specialists in the field.

  
DIGITAL’s research and training framework is tightly integrated into the European Digital Finance Package with substantial involvement of the European Central Bank as one of our partners and will contribute to one of the four EU’s key strategic orientations, namely the promotion of an open strategic autonomy through the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains that further accelerate the digital and green transition of Europe.

Research Topics

## Research Topics

Today, Digital Finance does not exist as a standalone research discipline, despite many research gaps, the EU’s key strategic priorities and the urgent needs from industry. DIGITAL will overcome this and significantly advance the methodologies and business models for Digital Finance through the use of FIVE interconnected and coherent research objectives and a total of seventeen Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) hired by different faculties around Europe.
