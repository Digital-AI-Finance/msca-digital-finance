## What is MSCA Digital Finance?

We are an Industrial Doctoral Network established within the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions which aims at training highly skilled doctoral candidates in Digital Finance. 

What is a MSCA Doctoral Network?

​

DIGITAL will specifically train young researchers in R&D topics that cover the multiple disciplines required in the rapidly evolving field of Digital Finance substantially going beyond the traditional Finance PhD education in a wide range of inter-sectoral applications: data quality, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), Explainability of AI (XAI), Blockchain applications and Sustainable Finance.

​

Start: 01 January 2024

​

End: 31 December 2027

​

Budget: EUR 4,473,972

## Research Topics & Individual Research Project

Currently, Digital Finance lacks recognition as an independent research field, despite numerous research voids, alignment with the EU's core strategic goals, and pressing industry demands. DIGITAL aims to address this gap and notably enhance Digital Finance methodologies and business models by pursuing five interconnected and cohesive research objectives.

## Secondments

The DIGITAL program offers unique and enriching secondment opportunities for all doctoral candidates, ensuring a well-rounded academic and applied experience.

​

Each candidate will dedicate 18 months to the non-academic sector, engaging themselves in a hands-on, real-world environment. This direct involvement in industry will help them bridge the gap between industry and academia.

Each candidate will also spend 4 months at a research centre and/or a government agency. This part of the program aims to give participants firsthand experience with the latest research and policy-making processes.

This combination of industry and research experience ensures that our doctoral candidates are not only well-versed in theoretical knowledge but also gain practical, real-world experience that is essential in today’s dynamic work environment.
