## About

Laura is an applied econometrician and mathematician with a broad interest in finance and economics and a special interest in the theme of risk & investments (banks, insurance companies and other large financial institutions). The continuous thread (not threat!) in her work is the use of econometric and statistical methods. The key message of a large part of her academic work is that such methods are essential for correctly answering research questions. 

  

During the past >20 years, she has designed and taught various BSc and MSc courses in the field of risk theory, actuarial finance, financial econometrics and applied statistics. She also has experience with executive teaching in the field of financial risk management. As a supervisor, she has supervised many BSc and MSc theses. Under her supervision as a promotor, several PhD students successfully completed and defended their thesis.
