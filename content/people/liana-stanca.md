## About

Liana Stanca holds a double BA degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (2001) and European Studies (1999). Her background in Mathematics and Computer Science has equipped her with a solid foundation in algorithms, programming in various languages, mathematics, logic, and statistics. Meanwhile, her European Studies degree has provided her with essential skills in managing European institutions, understanding European and national law, negotiation, conflict management, and notably, project management.

  

She earned her MA in 2003 and her Doctoral degree in 2005, both from Babeș-Bolyai University, with a thesis focused on Economic Informatics.

  

Liana's research interests encompass graphics and modeling, image processing, data visualization techniques, machine learning, and neural networks. Her primary focus is on the object recognition problem, which involves identifying and locating objects in intensity and range (depth) images. Object modeling is a crucial yet often implicit aspect of this recognition process, touching upon many fundamental issues in computer vision, graphics, and object modeling. Through her research, she has developed a comprehensive understanding of the core challenges within these fields.

  

Driven by a desire to expand her focus on planning sciences in social economic sciences, Liana aims to enhance her research and teaching in Business Informatics Systems. She believes that continuous professional development and benchmarking are vital for researchers and educators. Her participation in the FinAI Action allows her to assimilate new information and explore innovative approaches in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Liana is particularly enthusiastic about contributing to an inclusive community of researchers focused on methodological and technological themes in these fields, promoting Early Career Investigators and increasing their visibility in FinTech. She is eager to engage in the development of Machine Learning methods to analyze behavior within the FinTech sector.
