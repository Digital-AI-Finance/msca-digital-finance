## About

Yiting Liu, currently a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Twente, is delving into the intricacies of P2P lending risk modelling, a pivotal field at the intersection of finance and data analytics. With a comprehensive background in statistics and quantitative finance, he graduated with distinction from the Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, after completing his undergraduate studies at Fudan University’s School of Management. 

  

During his academic career, Yiting has been actively engaged in research projects that demonstrate his analytical acumen. Notably, his work on optimizing e-shopping service systems via man-machine cooperation addressed key efficiency improvements in customer service operations. Additionally, his innovative approach to extending the Bradley-Terry model provided new insights into paired data analysis. These projects underscore his dedication to advancing quantitative methods and risk assessment in financial contexts.
