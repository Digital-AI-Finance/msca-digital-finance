## About

Alessio is an Assistant Professor of Operations Research at the Industrial Engineering and Business Information Systems (IEBIS) group at the University of Twente (UT). Before joining UT, he obtained bachelor and master degrees in Mathematics from the University of Milan, a PhD in Operations Research from the Department of DTU Management at the Technical University of Denmark, and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Transport Planning and Systems (IVT) at ETH Zurich. In his research, he develops optimization models and algorithms for solving complex decision making problems arising in the energy, transportation, and logistics sectors (e.g., operations, planning, and investments), often in collaboration with the industry, using techniques including mathematical programming, network algorithms, and stochastic optimization with focus on approximate dynamic programming. He has published my research in well-known scientific journals within operations research, transportation, and energy, including FT50 journals as Management Science and Manufacturing & Service Operations Management. He received the 2020 Early Career Best Paper Award by INFORMS ENRE (Energy, Natural Resources and the Environment), the 2021 Best Paper Award by CEMA (Commodity and Energy Markets Association), and was a 2021 Finalist of the EURO Excellence in Practice Award (EEPA).
