He obtained his BSc-Eng from Princeton University in 1989, his MSc and PhD from UC Berkeley in 1991 and 1994, respectively, and his Habilitation from U. Nice (France) in 2000, all in Computer Science. He has been Tenured Researcher at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis (France) since 1995, on leave since 2002, and adjunct researcher since 2017. He has been a visiting researcher at Tsukuba Lab, Western U. (Canada), ENS Paris, IHES Paris, Ecole Centrale Paris, ETHZ, USI Lugano. His research interests span Scientific and Geometric Computing, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Bioinformatics. He has been founder and head of the Lab on Geometric and Algebraic Algorithms, and has been involved in 14 European research projects (e.g. FET, MSCA, I4MS, eGov) of which he has coordinated 3, and in a number of national and bilateral projects. He has been adviser to 14 PhD and 8 post-doctoral fellows, and he has coordinated the MSc program on “Data science & Information technologies” (2018-21). He is the author of a textbook on Computational Geometry, co-editor of two collections of chapters, and author of more than 120 journal articles and peer-reviewed conference publications, of which two earned the Distinguished Paper Award at ACM International Symposium on Symbolic & Algebraic Computation (ISSAC). Google Scholar Citations reports reports more than 4500 citations to his an H-index of 41.
