### Research Interests

As a researcher in statistics and econometrics I have contributed significantly to various fields, which can be summarized in six main research directions:

Insurance and Economic Behavior:

(1) Investigated the nexus between life insurance demand and institutional, knowledge, and behavioral factors in Europe, exploring how these aspects influence insurance purchasing decisions.

(2) Health Economics: Analyzed biomarkers for acute cerebrovascular diseases and the role of voluntary health insurance in improving health outcomes, reflecting an interest in the intersection of health and economics.

(3) Econometric Modeling: Applied econometric models to a wide range of economic phenomena, including the impact of financial sectors on economic growth and consumer behavior in insurance markets.

(4) Environmental Economics: Explored the impact of environmental policies on economic behaviors, including taxation's role in motor liability insurance and the dynamics of crop insurance.

(5) Scientometrics: Conducted bibliometric analyses to understand the factors affecting scientific productivity, particularly in environmental sciences, economics, and business.

(6) Consumer Protection and Perception: Examined how economic policies affect consumer rights and perceptions, including studies on price analysis in the energy sector and the influence of institutional factors on consumer protection in the EU.

These areas highlight the researcher's interdisciplinary approach, addressing key issues in health, insurance, environmental policies, and consumer protection through advanced econometric and statistical methodologies.
