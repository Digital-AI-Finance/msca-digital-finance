**February 20-22, 2025 | American University of Sharjah, UAE**

  

The [_Fourth International Conference on Mathematics and Statistics (ICMS25),_](/events/msca-digital-the-4th-international-conference-on-mathematics-and-statistics/) hosted by the American University of Sharjah, will serve as a premier forum for scholars, industry experts, and policymakers to discuss cutting-edge research and advancements in mathematical sciences and statistical methodologies. Against the backdrop of rapid technological progress and evolving financial ecosystems, this conference will provide an interdisciplinary platform to explore the role of mathematical and statistical tools in economic, financial, and technological developments.

  

[_Joerg Osterrieder_](/people/joerg-osterrieder/) , PI of MSCA DIGITAL, continues to foster the close partnerships the project has with participants beyond the core network, and notably by participating at ICMS25 in multiple capacities, contributing to discussions on high-frequency trading, financial econometrics, and digital finance. The engagements at the conference will include:

  

**Conference Talk: Reaction Times to Economic News in High-Frequency Trading.**

Financial markets are increasingly characterized by the speed and efficiency of information processing. Joerg's invited talk is on Reaction Times to Economic News in High-Frequency Trading: An Analysis of Latency and Informed Trading Ahead of Macro-News Announcements, will delve into the mechanisms by which traders react to macroeconomic news releases. By analyzing latency dynamics, order flow imbalances, and market microstructure effects, this presentation will provide insights into how information asymmetry shapes market efficiency. This discussion has significant implications for policymakers overseeing market integrity and regulatory frameworks in algorithmic trading environments.

  

**Membership in the International Advisory Board.**

As a member of the International Advisory Board of ICMS25, Joerg and the MSCA DIGITAL project and network contributes to shaping the intellectual direction of the conference, ensuring that emerging challenges in mathematics and statistics are adequately addressed. This role aligns with broader commitments to fostering academic discourse that bridges theoretical advancements with real-world applications in finance, technology, and policy.

  

**Chairing the Special Session on Statistics and Data Science for Digital Finance (SS9) – Tokenomics.**

The proliferation of blockchain technology and digital assets has ushered in a new era of financial innovation. Chairing the Special Session on Statistics and Data Science for Digital Finance – Tokenomics (SS9) will facilitate discussions on the mathematical and statistical foundations of token economies. This session will highlight novel research on market microstructure, valuation models for digital assets, and the intersection of decentralized finance (DeFi) with statistical learning. The deliberations will be particularly relevant for policymakers seeking data-driven insights into the regulatory challenges posed by digital financial ecosystems.

Looking AheadICMS25 represents a unique convergence of expertise from academia, industry, and regulatory bodies, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations that will shape future research agendas. The discussions on high-frequency trading, algorithmic market dynamics, and digital finance will not only advance theoretical understanding but also inform policy frameworks governing financial markets.

We look forward to engaging with scholars, practitioners, and policymakers at ICMS25, exchanging perspectives that will drive impactful research and policy developments in the years to come!
