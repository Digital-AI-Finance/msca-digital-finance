On the 4th of December 2024, as part of the MSCA WP3 Research Seminar, Renata Guizzardi hosted an insightful talk on Ethical Requirements for AI Systems.

  

The session provided a great overview on how ethical requirements can be deployed for AI systems and inspired a lively and engaging debate among participants.

  

Renata highlighted how ontologies can support awareness and guide the development of engineering practices for creating ethical and trustworthy systems. She emphasized that these principles must be explicitly embedded in system engineering methods and shared her current efforts in the development of ontology-based requirements engineering.
