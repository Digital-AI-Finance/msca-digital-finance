Last week, the University of Twente hosted a week of technical training and the MidTerm Meeting of the MSCA Digital project. The week provided a unique opportunity to gather our international consortium of researchers, academic institutions, and industry partners.

  

Attended in person by many academic and industry partners from all across Europe, the event was an opportunity to reflect on our progress since the project’s launch, and to look ahead with renewed purpose and momentum.

  

The MidTerm Meeting with the European Union's Research Executive Agency (REA), held on Wednesday, was particularly noteworthy. Gergana Simeonova-Arida, the REA officer responsible for our project, had the chance to engage directly with our researchers, project managers and doctoral candidates, offering constructive feedback and learning more about the collaboration within the project. It was encouraging to see recognition for the project's interdisciplinary approach and its alignment with the EU’s broader goals for innovation in digital finance.

  

Equally inspiring was the progress showcased by our doctoral candidates. Throughout the week, they presented their research, exchanged ideas with peers and mentors, and participated in technical training sessions (e.g., on Ethics in Digital Finance) designed to equip them with skills critical for the evolving digital finance landscape. Their energy, curiosity, and dedication were a testament to the strength of the program and its potential to shape the next generation of thought leaders.

  

The training week also served as a reminder of the rich diversity and expertise within our network. We look forward to continuing this collaborative journey as our doctoral candidates deepen and advance their work and start their secondments.
