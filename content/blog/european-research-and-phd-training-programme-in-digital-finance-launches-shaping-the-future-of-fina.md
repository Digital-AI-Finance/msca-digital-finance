In a significant move towards strengthening Europe's position in the global financial technology sector, the European Research and PhD Training Programme in Digital Finance, under the aegis of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA), officially launches today. This ambitious initiative, spanning from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2027, is set to carve out a new path in financial technology research and development.   

**A Multidisciplinary Approach with Transformative Potential:** The programme offers 19 PhD positions that integrate finance, technology, and data science. Joerg Osterrieder, Coordinator of the MSCA Doctoral Network at the University of Twente, articulates the vision, "This is more than a training programme; it's a crucible for future leaders in digital finance. We're focusing on interdisciplinary research, particularly at the crossroads of finance and AI, to tackle the sophisticated challenges of today’s financial world." Echoing this vision, Martijn Mes and Branka Hadji Misheva, both renowned professors at the University of Twente and Bern Business School respectively, emphasize the programme's commitment to integrating advanced technology in finance and ensuring societal benefits through transparent and inclusive financial services.
