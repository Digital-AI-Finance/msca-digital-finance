[ _Dr. Frédérik Sinan Bernard_](https://www.digital-finance-msca.com/people/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9rik-sinan-bernard) was invited to talk on 18 June 2024 at [_the monthly research seminar_](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/iebis/seminar/240618/) of the faculty Industrial Engineering and Business Information (IEBIS) of the University of Twente. His talk centred around Economic Intelligence (EI) and how we can ensure disruptive technology, such as blockchain, will have a positive societal impact within EI. He argues that most importantly experts and academia should join forces to ensure the opportunities technological advances bring forth while mitigating both tactical and strategic risks. This is done through coordinated and structured research with an open-ended invitation to participate. In this regard, central bank digital currencies, one of the applications of blockchain technology, might have to rely on crypto-economic intelligence (CEI) to strengthen their potential for significantly positive societal impact. Additionally, he argues that CEI considerations should be incorporated within development process of EI systems on a European level, allowing central regulators to be included in the discussion.
