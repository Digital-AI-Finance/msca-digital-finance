## Overview

Blockchain is another driver of the technological change of the financial ecosystem, though there are no systematic studies that assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs. DIGITAL will analyse the efficiency of financial service providers that adopt the blockchain technology, contribute to more robust and efficient financial markets by understanding how to tokenize financial assets, reduce the risk of fraud and highly volatile crypto assets and establish a global, industrial standard for the architecture of blockchain-based financial systems.

The research will focus on developing Blockchain-based use cases and designing systematic studies aimed at advancing financial digital innovation. These studies will serve as a crucial input for a new infrastructure that will be utilised in a wide variety of IT domains. This infrastructure will account for the integration of multiple data sources, define a standard dictionary, eliminate ambiguity, and enable other teams to access all customer data from a centralised repository, thereby ensuring interoperability. Defining and monitoring efficiency measures will ensure the quality of the proposed frameworks. In addition, a qualitative evaluation will be conducted based on the comparison of our proposed frameworks that go beyond the state of the art of traditional standard approaches. This is intended to serve as the basis for a new blockchain-based financial infrastructure and as a European industry standard for blockchain applications. In addition, the research will also focus on proposing novel risk management solutions to some of the main concerns around blockchain applications in finance, like fraud detection and financial stability.

WP4 Doctoral Candidate 3

TO BE HIRED  

## Research topics

Under this research stream, THREE doctoral candidates will tackle the following research projects:

### Machine learning for digital finance

[Machine learning for digital finance](/industry-standard-for-blockchain/)

Description:  The project aims to design and enhance the functionality and user interaction of applications that model Early Warning Signals.

It will develop models and frameworks that leverage big data analytics, focusing on refining usability to improve clarity for various

stakeholders. This project also seeks to implement and evaluate explainability methods to determine their impact on the decision-makingprocesses of internal customers within financial institutions. The goal is to enhance their ability to provide accurate feedback and reporting and to facilitate implementing necessary corrections

  

Host: [University of Twente](/partners/university-of-twente/)

  

Planned Secondments:

European Central Bank (ECB). Lukasz Kubicki, M21, 12 months, exposure to globally leading central bank, research training on EU principles, supervision

Fraunhofer (FRA). Prof. Dr. Ralf Korn, M33, 6 months, applied industry-research, contribute to multiple projects on blockchain and decentralized finance

Swedbank (SWE). Prof. Dr. Tadas Gudaitis, M39, 6 months, ESG and credit score modelling

  

### Fraud detection in financial networks

[Fraud detection in financial networks](/fraud-detection-in-financial-networks/)

Description:  Detecting fraud is currently one of the most important topics in Finance. However, it is also one of the most complex, given that fraudsters typically represent and generate a highly dynamic system, requiring that the boundaries and objectives of any system designed to detect and reduce fraud be constantly adapted to new extrinsic structures. This enables the definition of not only a static fraud detection system, but also a dynamic AI learning system, particularly in relation to network analysis.

  

Host: [WU Vienna University of Economics and Business](/wu-vienna-university-of-economics/)

  

Planned Secondments:

Raiffeisen Bank International (RAI), Dr. Stefan Theußl, M27, 18 months, research exposure in a global business environment

### Risk index for cryptos 

[Risk index for cryptos](/risk-index-for-cryptos/)

Description:  The cryptocurrency market is exceptional: it is volatile, with a constantly shifting market structure. As cryptocurrencies evolve into a class of investable assets, the need for an index product arises. We investigate the dependencies of tail risk events within cryptocurrencies, which entails identifying coins with high or low joint tail event risks. Based on this, we intend to develop a risk index for cryptocurrencies to measure joint tail events, which will be an important tool for communicating risks to the public and regulators.

  

Host: [Poznań University of Economics and Business](https://www.digital-finance-msca.com/pozna%C5%84-university-of-economics-and-business)

  

Planned Secondments:

Royalton Partners (ROY), Dr. Michael Althof, M27, 18 months, research in innovation-driven business, use-case implementation
