Overview

AI has improved decision making in numerous areas, including risk management, compliance, trading strategies and personalised banking and advice, and yet, adoption of AI-based tools in practice has still been rather slow. With DIGITAL, we will describe the primary challenges and opportunities for industry's adoption of technological development, encourage a larger deployment of state-of-the-art ML models in real-world financial applications and simulate the market environment in Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications for market applications.

In this research topic, the emphasis will be placed on the deployment of complex AI models to pertinent financial problems. For financial applications such as risk management, trading strategies, and client-centric financial products, AI models trained and tested in closed, academic settings have shown great promise. Yet, real-world applications (in open environments) are more challenging. Using industry-ready use cases, we will demonstrate the viability of novel dynamic rating models, automated trading platforms, and market environments for RL agents in real-industry settings for the first time. This research will provide first-of-its-kind qualitative analysis of the primary obstacles to deploying innovative technologies in industry and propose new solutions for resolving these obstacles which in turn is a crucial step towards a widespread adoption of complex models in the financial sector.

Research topics

Under this research stream, TWO doctoral candidates will tackle the following research projects:

Developing industry-ready automated trading systems to conduct EcoFin analysis using deep learning algorithms

Developing industry-ready automated trading systems to conduct EcoFin analysis using deep learning algorithms

Description:

This IRP will focus on addressing the challenges associated with automated trading systems in the direction of industry-ready platforms, i.e. minimising the risks of mechanical failures, improving the explainability of the underlying AI/ML models used in automated trading systems to better address performance-related issues, and also addressing ESG/CSR and ethical issues. This area will contribute significantly to Green Finance, thereby addressing the European Green Deal.

Challenges and opportunities for the uptaking of technological development by industry

Challenges and opportunities for the uptaking of technological development by industry

Description:

The building blocks of any institutional investor's loan portfolio are cash flows. Using public and proprietary data, the doctoral candidate will conduct research and develop a machine learning tool capable of performing grouped time series forecasting on a private debt portfolio spanning multiple geographies, sectors, and whose features can also be grouped at other levels, such as loan amount and interest rate. In our innovation-driven industry, we analyse the obstacles and opportunities associated with adopting technological advances.
