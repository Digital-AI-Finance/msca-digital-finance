### A recommender system to re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies

  * Host institution: University of Twente, The Netherlands (UTW)

  * Starting month: M9

  * Duration: 36 months

  * Pillar 1: Sustainable finance (University of Naples Federico II, 4 ECTs), Work Package 5

  * Work Packages: WP5, WP6, WP7, WP8

  * Lead researcher: [Mohamed Faid](/people/mohamed-faid/)

### Objectives

Recommender systems are well-known information filtering systems that suggest items most relevant to a user. To our knowledge, there are none that suggest investments in sustainable technologies and businesses. This project will develop and deploy a recommender system to help financial institutions and their clients invest in sustainable technologies.

### Expected Results

The project informs user groups about investment sustainability. Sustainability KPI mapping and evaluation are project deliverables. The recommender system's explainability is crucial. Thus, the recommendations will be tailored to multiple user classes with appropriate explanations and interpretations. The system recommends sustainable investments, monitors portfolio performance, and dynamically updates financial and sustainable KPIs.

### Planned Secondments

  * Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Rafael Schmidt, M21, 18 months, contribute macro-economic datasets, ongoing projects as well as overall expertise in banking supervision

  * Athena Research and Innovation Center (ARC). Prof. Dr. Ioannis Emiris, M39, 6 months, applied industry-research, work on the technological aspects of recommender systems
