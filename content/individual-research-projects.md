The DIGITAL program is designed to drive forward the digitalizations of finance by assigning each doctoral candidate a specific project that addresses different aspects of the field. These projects have specific objectives and expected outcomes, covering a wide range of topics such as: collaborative learning across data silos, detecting anomalies and dependencies in high dimensional financial data, language models, reinforcement and deep learning, eXplaianble AI, blockchain technology standards, and many more. Doctoral Candidates (DCs) are expected to produce at least three papers during their PhD program, with a minimum of two involving collaboration within their network. They must also participate in three conferences and present at two academic and one industry seminar each year. These requirements aim to promote collaboration, spread knowledge, and support the DCs' academic and professional growth while fully delivering the IRPs research objectives.
