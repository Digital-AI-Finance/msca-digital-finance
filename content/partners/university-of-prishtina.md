### University of Prishtina

### General Description

Prior to the establishment of Kosovo as an independent state, the University of Prishtina was initially enacted by the then Social Autonomous Province of Kosova on 18 November 1969, which provided a legal status and mandate of the institution as a degree awarding body.  
  
In 2003, during the Balkans post-conflict period, reforms were solicited through a new strategy for higher education policy, which resulted in the adoption of the University Statute in 2004. Processes and regulations were set in place to serve as a foundation for future capacity development and quality assurance.  
  
The contribution of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was instrumental in securing enhancement in areas of quality assurance and curricula implementation through cooperation with foreign universities.  
  
Presently, the University of Prishtina comprises fourteen faculties.
