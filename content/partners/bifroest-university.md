### Bifröst University

### General Description

Bifröst University, established in 1918 as the Cooperative College (Samvinnuskólinn) in Reykjavík, has a rich history of adapting to Iceland’s evolving educational needs. Initially focused on training cooperative movement members, it relocated in 1955 to its current scenic campus in Norðurárdalur, approximately 30 kilometers north of Borgarnes. This move marked a significant transformation into a residential institution, fostering a close-knit academic community.   
  
Today, Bifröst University offers accredited undergraduate and graduate programs in Business, Law, and Social Sciences. As Iceland’s sole specialized distance-learning university, it provides flexible education that accommodates students’ diverse circumstances. This approach allows students to access lectures anytime, anywhere, aligning with modern educational trends and sustainability goals. ​  
  
The university emphasizes practical education that mirrors current industry demands, preparing students to thrive in a digitalized world. It operates under the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), underscoring its commitment to responsible leadership, social responsibility, and sustainability. Bifröst’s core values—initiative, cooperation, and responsibility—are integral to its mission.  
  
In recent years, Bifröst University has seen significant growth in its diverse master’s programs, attracting students from various backgrounds. Notably, the university launched an online master’s program in International Political Economy, taught entirely in English, marking a significant step toward increased internationalization. The university’s unique Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) distinguishes it within Iceland’s educational landscape, offering a foundation similar to that of many British political leaders.
