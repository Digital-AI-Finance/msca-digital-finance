### Deutsche Bank

### General Description

Deutsche Bank is the leading German bank with strong European roots and a global network. It provides financial services to companies, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses and private individuals.   
  
Deutsche Bank was founded in 1870 to accompany German businesses into the world, and has worked across borders ever since. It has established strong bases in all major emerging markets, and therefore has good prospects for business growth in fast-growing economies, including the Asia Pacific region, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America.
