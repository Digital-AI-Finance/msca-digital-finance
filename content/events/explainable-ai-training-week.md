**Title: From Models to Systems: Advancing Explainable AI in Financial Decision-Making**

We'll cover a couple of use cases, ranging from credit default prediction on tabular loan data to retrieval-augmented data extraction from transaction documents. In the former case, literature and explainability practices in the financial industry seem to be fairly well aligned—notably, the use of Shapley values keeps gaining ground—while explainability in the latter remains an active area of research. To compensate for the lack of consolidated methods, we'll combine careful design with the selective adoption of techniques from recent literature. We’ll see how putting these concepts into practice can make our users’ life easier—especially when the user is interacting with a "system" of models rather than a single model.

**Title: Explainable AI for Electricity Price Anomaly Detection: A SHAP-Driven Approach in Romania’s Energy Market**

This research presents an approach to anomaly detection in electricity price data using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. The study focuses on the Romanian electricity market, analyzing hourly price data alongside generation and load variables to identify and explain price anomalies. We use Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and Random Forest for predictive modeling, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide interpretability of the detected anomalies. Our methodology categorizes anomalies into price spikes, price drops, and other anomalies, revealing distinct patterns in each category. Results show that renewable energy generation, particularly wind and solar, significantly influences price drops, while load forecast deviations and conventional generation constraints contribute to price spikes. This framework offers insights for market participants and regulators, enabling better understanding of market dynamics and potentially improving forecasting accuracy and market stability. This research contributes to the growing field of explainable AI applications in energy markets by providing a transparent methodology that bridges the gap between black-box anomaly detection and actionable market intelligence.

**Jurgita Černevičienė** is a lecturer and PhD candidate in Computer Science (2022–present) at the Department of Mathematical Modelling at Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania. She holds an MSc in Mathematics (Business Big Data Analytics), which motivated her deeper focus on Artificial Intelligence. Her research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of XAI in finance—linking model transparency to measurable risk-management outcomes. Beyond XAI for risk assessment, she investigates data-driven properties of digital-asset markets, evaluating stylized facts in cryptocurrencies; she is also certified in the Google Data Analytics program. Current work extends to investment decision-making and portfolio management, aiming to connect interpretable ML with practical allocation and risk-control strategies.

  

**Title: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in finance: a systematic literature review**

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a vital research domain in finance, where transparency, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder confidence are paramount. Through a review of recent literature, we define four enduring challenges to successful adoption: (i) customizing explanations for the appropriate audience (experts versus end-users); (ii) a scarcity of truly innovative XAI methodologies, with numerous studies merely augmenting the interpretability of ML models rather than progressing XAI itself; (iii) the lack of standardized, universally recognized evaluation metrics for assessing explanation quality; and (iv) persistent information-security risks that threaten model integrity and trust. Despite these challenges, findings show that XAI can strengthen risk assessment, credit scoring, fraud detection, and regulatory alignment by clarifying drivers of model outputs and improving decision confidence. Notable advances—such as the S.A.F.E. trustworthiness criteria, the KAIRI risk-monitoring framework, and interpretable toolkits like Aletheia and PiML—signal progress toward more reliable and auditable systems. Nevertheless, gaps remain around domain-aware evaluation standards, rigorous security hardening, and applications beyond credit—especially portfolio optimization and internet financing. Overall, the evidence indicates that XAI can bridge the performance–trust gap in financial AI when paired with audience-appropriate explanations, robust metrics, and close collaboration between data scientists and finance professionals.
