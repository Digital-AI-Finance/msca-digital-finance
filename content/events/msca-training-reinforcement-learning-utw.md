## About the event

**Register on Meetup:**[ MSCA Training Week - UT](https://www.meetup.com/fintech_ai_in_finance/events/302419080/?slug=fintech_ai_in_finance&isFirstPublish=true)

  

  

The 4EC doctoral training course "Reinforcement Learning in Digital Finance" offers a comprehensive exploration of reinforcement learning (RL), which is a powerful framework to support sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

  

Candidates will delve into the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning, state-of-the-art algorithms, and practical applications within the digital finance domain. RL can facilitate and enhance sequential decision-making processes and services in finance, such as algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, risk management, and fraud detection. Doctoral candidates will gain a solid understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of RL as well as practical experience in implementing reinforcement learning algorithms to solve real-world financial problems. The applications will consider constraints and regulations that concern privacy, algorithmic bias, and explainability.

  

By the end of the course, candidates will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to leverage reinforcement learning for optimizing control, enhancing performance, and improving services in the dynamic landscape of digital finance.

**Anne Zander** is an Assistant Professor in Applied Mathematics at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. She studied Mathematics and Physics and earned a Ph.D. in 2021 from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, working on Operations Research methods applied to Healthcare Logistics. Her theoretical research focuses on sequential decision problems, particularly high-dimensional, discrete decision spaces. To solve those problems, she aims to integrate lookahead planning via Stochastic Programming and learning from past experience via Reinforcement Learning. Her main field of application is Healthcare Logistics. Currently, Anne Zander participates in and leads several projects in close collaboration with healthcare providers related to capacity planning during infectious outbreaks or improving the patient flow from hospitals to follow-up care.

**Warren B Powell** is Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, where he taught for 39 years, and is currently the Chief Innovation Officer at Optimal Dynamics. He was the founder and director of CASTLE Lab, which focused on stochastic optimization with applications to freight transportation, energy systems, health, e-commerce, finance and the laboratory sciences, supported by over $50 million in funding from government and industry. He has pioneered a new universal framework that can be used to model any sequential decision problem, including the identification of four classes of policies that spans every possible method for making decisions. This is documented in his latest book with John Wiley: Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization: A unified framework for sequential decisions.
