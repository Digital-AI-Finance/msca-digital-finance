## Time & Location

Seminar Room EG 1, RBI Head Office, Am Stadtpark 9, 1030 Wien, Austria

## About the event

**About the Event**

This intensive program is designed to equip participants with the skills to develop AI agents using OpenAI APIs, with a strong emphasis on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and agentic architectures. Through hands-on instruction and guided implementation, participants will learn to master the use of OpenAI APIs for AI agent tasks, implement both standard and Agentic RAG strategies, design robust agentic architectures, and deploy fully functional agentic systems in practical settings.

  

**Prior Knowledge**

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and some programming experience, preferably in Python. To ensure a smooth start, approximately six hours of pre-course preparation is recommended. This includes readings on core topics such as AI agent concepts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodologies, and the OpenAI API documentation. In addition, participants should review and examine sample API integrations and basic agent scripts to become familiar with practical implementation aspects before the course begins.
