## About the event

**Information**

The aim of the BIP is to create an interdisciplinary course on advanced topics in the field of statistics and probability, with applications in the Fintech sector and Artificial Intelligence on key topics included in the UN SDGs.

The programme will enable participants to understand and develop analyses on financial instruments using appropriate techniques. Starting from the theoretical analysis of the technical-conceptual determinants and the regulatory environment of AI, models will be presented and the results of field tests of the experience gained in the adoption of models of the kind will be presented.

The programme aims to provide analytical skills to create, manage and interrogate large datasets applicable to the financial sector and to build critical awareness of current issues in the Fintech landscape. A set of programming tools will facilitate the implementation of models and enable participants to analyse decision-making processes.

**Learning and Teaching Methods**

The learning method is divided into virtual and face-to-face sessions, focused on case studies of real data management. The learning methodology will combine lectures of the methodologies to practical workshops aimed at implementing the techniques presented on the case studies.
